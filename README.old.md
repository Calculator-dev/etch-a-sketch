- Welcome to Etch a Sketch coloring game

# Application description

-Etch a Sketch is a coloring game. The user is choosing starting size of the grid in a range from 16x16 to 100x100. After the grid is created user can start coloring on the grid, with the mouse hovering on each square on the screen. By default black color is chosen, but the user has one more option and its random coloring by clicking on the button "Random color". With every hover, another color is shown on each square, after choosing "Random Color". To clear the grid user must press the "Clear Board" button, every square is going to back the default color (white) and the grid doesn't change its size.
